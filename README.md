## About fritzbox-telegraf-plugin
This [Telegraf](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf) input plugin gathers stats from [AVM](https://avm.de/) FRITZ!Box devices. It uses the device's [TR-064](https://avm.de/service/schnittstellen/) interfaces to retrieve the stats. DSL routers as well as WLAN repeaters are supported.

### Installation
To install the plugin you have to download a suitable [release archive](https://github.com/hdecarne-github/fritzbox-telegraf-plugin/releases) and extract it or build it from source by cloning the repository and issueing a simple
```
make
```
To build the plugin, Go version 1.16 or higher is required. The resulting plugin binary will be written to `./build/bin`.
Copy the either extracted or built plugin binary to a location of your choice (e.g. /usr/local/bin/telegraf/).

### Run / Build via Docker
If the plugin is not available for your desired target platform (e.g. for your Rapberry Pi), you can still build and run it using Docker, regardless of whether Telegraf is installed on your machine. To do this, simply execute the corresponding script in the /docker/ directory.

For building the plugin, run the docker-build.sh script. Before executing, you might need to make the script executable with the command chmod +x docker-build.sh. To start the plugin, use the docker-run.sh script, making it executable if necessary with chmod +x docker-run.sh.

Before starting, ensure to customize the two configuration files located in the /docker/config/ directory according to your needs.

### Configuration
This is an [external plugin](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/blob/master/docs/EXTERNAL_PLUGINS.md) which has to be integrated via Telegraf's [excecd plugin](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/execd).

To use it you have to create a plugin specific config file (e.g. /etc/telegraf/fritzbox.conf) with following template content:
```toml
[[inputs.fritzbox]]
  ## The fritz devices to query (multiple triples of base url, login, password)
  devices = [["http://fritz.box:49000", "", ""]]
  ## The http timeout to use (in seconds)
  # timeout = 10
  ## Skip TLS verification (insecure)
  # tls_skip_verify = false
  ## Process Device services (if found)
  # get_device_info = true
  ## Process WLAN services (if found)
  # get_wlan_info = true
  ## Process WAN services (if found)
  # get_wan_info = true
  ## Process DSL services (if found)
  # get_dsl_info = true
  ## Process PPP services (if found)
  # get_ppp_info = true
  ## Process Mesh infos for selected hosts (must be one of the hosts defined in devices)
  # get_mesh_info = []
  ## Get all mesh clients from mesh info
  # get_mesh_clients = false
  ## The type of mesh clients to report (WLAN, LAN; empty list reports all)
  # mesh_client_types = ["WLAN"]
  ## The cycle count, at which low-traffic stats are queried
  # full_query_cycle = 6
  ## Enable debug output
  # debug = false
```
The most important setting is the `devices` line. It defines the base URLs of devices to query as well as the credentials (login + password) to use for authentication. At least one device has to be defined.
The flags (`get_*_info`) control which stats are polled and are described in the sections below.

To enable the plugin within your Telegraf instance, add the following section to your `telegraf.conf`
```toml
[[inputs.execd]]
  command = ["/usr/local/bin/telegraf/fritzbox-telegraf-plugin", "-config", "/etc/telegraf/fritzbox.conf", "-poll_interval", "10s"]
  signal = "none"
```
The polling interval defined here interacts with the `full_query_cycle` option above. The plugin gathers it's stats every 10s. Every 6th run (60s) it performs all configured queries. In between only the WAN stats are queried. By adapting the two options `poll_interval` and `full_query_cycle` you control the update frequency as well as the resulting system load.

#### Device Info (get_device_info)
Reports the `fritzbox_device` measurement:
```
fritzbox_device,fritz_device=fritz.box,service=DeviceInfo1 uptime=773607i,model_name="FRITZ!Box 7590" 1647203021364800000
```
The uptime (in seconds) as well as the model name are reported for every configured device.

#### WLAN Info (get_wlan_info)
Reports the `fritzbox_wlan` measurement:
```
fritzbox_wlan,fritz_wlan_channel=fritz.box:MySSID:11,fritz_wlan_network=fritz.box:MySSID:2G,fritz_device=fritz.box,service=WLANConfiguration1 total_associations=2i 1647203147521085000
fritzbox_wlan,fritz_wlan_channel=fritz.box:MySSID:44,fritz_wlan_network=fritz.box:MySSID:5G,fritz_device=fritz.box,service=WLANConfiguration2 total_associations=7i 1647203148048754000
```
For every device and every configured WLAN (2.4 GHz and 5 GHz are considered separate WLANs here) a stats line is created reporting the number of currently associated clients.

#### Mesh Info (get_mesh_info)
Reports the `fritzbox_mesh` measurement:
```
fritzbox_mesh,fritz_device=fritz.box,fritz_mesh_node_link=slave1:WLAN:UPLINK:5G:0,fritz_mesh_node_name=slave1,fritz_mesh_node_type=WLAN,service=Hosts1 max_data_rate_rx=1300000i,max_data_rate_tx=1300000i,cur_data_rate_rx=1300000i,cur_data_rate_tx=1170000i 1647924367458027000
```
